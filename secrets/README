The secrets in this directory are used in the tests, which generally
should only be run in a private environment that can't be connected from
the outside.  As such, the fact that these secrets are in a public
github repository isn't a big deal.

For actual deployment, make sure you get secrets from somewhere else!
Don't bind mount this directory to /secrets!
