    "# Querying the TOM's database directly\n",
    "\n",
    "For this to work, you must have an account on the DESC TOM.  If you need one and don't have one, contact Rob Knop (e.g. on Slack).\n",
    "\n",
    "The interfaces below are based on python `requests` and `psycopg2` (for connecting to a PostgreSQL database).  Hopefully the examples will make clear everything you need, but some of this will be more obvious if you're familiar with those two things.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The postgres database behind the DESC TOM is not externally available.  You may be able to get what you need by using the various REST interfaces the DESC TOM provides.  For a couple of examples:\n",
    "* https://github.com/LSSTDESC/elasticc_metrics/blob/main/elasticc2_rest_metric_demo.ipynb for querying ELAsTiCC2 metrics\n",
    "* https://github.com/LSSTDESC/tom_desc?tab=readme-ov-file#elasticc2spec for getting information about hot transients, requested spectra, and for pushing information about spectra you've taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to access the SQL database directly, there are two web APIs, one for fast queries, one for slow queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fast Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "For fast queries, you can use the API endpoint `db/runsqlquery/`.  You POST to this URL with the query you want to run in the POST data, and get back JSON including the results of your query.  This is documented with examples below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Slow Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "The web proxy to the TOM will time out if a request takes more than 5 minutes.  So, if your SQL query is going to run more than a couple of minutes, the `db/runsqlquery/` interface won't work.  (ELAsTiCC2 has 990 million forced source datapoints and 380 million broker classification messages, so all it takes is the right table join and your query can take minutes and minutes... or more.)\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle this, there's another interface that let's you submit a query (or a series of queries).  They will all one in one transaction, so you can do things like create temporary tables with these queries.  After submitting the query, you'll get back a query id, which you send to a couple of different web API endpoints to check the status of your query, and (if it's done) to get the results.  On the back end, there is a process that will run these slow queries.  (At the moment, there's only a single thread running those queries, but in the future I will make this multi-threaded so one person submitting a 3-day query doesn't block everybody else.)\n",
    "\n",
    "This second interface is also documented with examples below."

    "# Connecting to the TOM\n",
    "\n",
    "To use either fast query or slow query interface, you need to connect to the DESC TOM.  You could accomplish this entirely using the python `requests` module, but there are some annoying things that django (the framework that the TOM works on) wants to see in headers.

    "# The Fast Query Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "If your query is going to take less than a couple of minutes, this is the one to use.  To run it, you send POST data to the endpoint `db/runsqlquery` on the DESC TOM.  The POST data should be a JSON encoded dictionary with keys:\n",
    "* `query`: str or list of str.  The SQL query to run, or a list of queries to run in order in a single transaction.\n",
    "* `subdict`: dict, list of dict, or None (default).  You can include `%(varname)s` in your SQL query, where `varname` can be any string.  Then, in your subdict, you should have `varname` as a key, and the value is what should be substituted into the query.  (These are as used in  the [psycopg2 cursor](https://www.psycopg.org/docs/cursor.html) \"execute\" method.)\n",
    "\n",
    "You should practice good SQL hygiene and make sure to use `subdict` to interpolate any calculated or user-inputted parameters.  However, don't worry too much; unless Rob screwed up horribly, the back-end uses a read-only postgres user, so you won't be able to [Bobby Tables](https://xkcd.com/327/) the database.  (Note that even though it's a read-only user, you _can_ still create temporary tables.)\n",
    "\n",
    "If all is well, the HTTP response you get from posting to that URL will have a status code of 200 (successful response).  If it's something else, it means that something went wrong, perhaps a timeout, perhaps something wrong server-side.  If everything worked server-side, but your SQL had an error in it, you should still get an HTTP status code response of 200.\n",
    "\n",
    "The response body will be JSON encoded; you can extract this as a dictionary by calling the `json()` method of the response object.  One key of the dictionary will be `status`; if the value is `ok`, then there will be a second key `rows`, whose value is an array of dictionaries holding the results of your query (or of the last query, if you submitted a list).  If `status` is `error`, then something went wrong, almost certainly an error in your SQL.  In this case, look at the value of the `error` key in the dictionary to get an error message.  This is shown below; first, we define a boilerplate function that does all of the error parsing, so that we don't have to redo that every time we send a new query."

(At the moment, there's no interface to see all queries you've submitted.  I will hopefully add that at some point.)\n",

    "## Submitting a query\n",
    "\n",
    "The POST data to `db/submitsqlquery/` must be a JSON-encoded dictionary with keys:\n",
    "* `query: str` : the query to run, with possible `%(varname)s` variables to be interpolated.  (See the docs on the fast query interface above.)\n",
    "* `queries: list of str` : a list of queries to run.  You must include exactly one of `query` or `queries`.\n",
    "* `subdict: dict` : the substitution dictionary to go with `query`.  Optional, if you have no variables to substitute.\n",
    "* `subdicts: list of dict` : the substitution dictionaries to go with `queries`.  Optional, if none of your queries have any variables to interpolate.  If specified, the length of the list must match the length of the list in `queries`.\n",
    "* `format: str` : the format you will want your data returned in; one of `csv`, `pandas`, or `numpy`.  If `csv`, you will get back text data in csv format (with actual commas separating the fields).  If `pandas`, you will get back a binary blob that is a pickled pandas object.  If `numpy`, you will get back an error, because that format isn't implemented yet.  If you don't specify `format`, it will default to `csv` (the least efficient, but most likely to be readable, format).\n",
    "\n",
    "If all is well, the response you get will have status code 200, and the body of the response will be a JSON-encoded dictionary; call that `resdict`.  (You can get `resdict` with something like `resdict=resp.json()`, if `resp` is the thing returned by your `TomClient.post()` call.)  If `resdict['status']` is `ok`, then `resdict['queryid']` has the id of your query.  Save this!  If you lose it, you won't be able to get your query results.  If `resdict['status']` is `error`, then look at `resdict['error']` to see if there's anything helpful there.\n",

Really, what you should so is submit your query, and then go get a cup of coffee, or sleep for the night, or go on a vacation to Paris.  When you're back, check to see if the query is done.

At the moment, only a single query can run at once, but if there are problems, I'll run multiple processes so we can have multiple queries running at once.\n",
