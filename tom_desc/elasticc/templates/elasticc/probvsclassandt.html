<h2>ELAsTiCC Metrics: Broker Probability vs. Class and Î”t</h2>

<p>(Generation is triggered manually, last on 2022-12-19 (in progress).)</p>
<!-- python manage.py gen_classprob_vs_t -->

<p>The plots below are divided by Broker/Classifier and by the true type
  of the object.  For each true type, we average the reported
  probabilities over all objects of that true type, separating them out
  by the broker's classification and by 5-day time bins.  Time is
  relative to the true peak time of the object.  (That is "whatever the
  peak time is in the truth table"; I'm not sure what that is for
  non-transients.)</p>

<p>Shortcoming alert: the heat map represents the avereage of all
  provided classifications for objects of a given true type and for a
  given time range.  Classifications that have not been provided should
  probably be averaged in as a 0% classification, but right now they are
  not.  What this means is that, for example, if there are 1,000 Type Ia
  supernovae, and a broker classified <i>one</i> of them at t=0 as an
  AGN, but never gave a probability for AGN for any of the others, on
  this plot that would show up as on average a high AGN probability at
  t=0 for Type Ia supernovae, even though it should really show up as
  only 10<span class="sup">-3</span>.  It's not clear how big an issue
  this really is in practice.</p>
