<h2>ELAsTiCC Broker Time Delays</h2>

<p>Updated {{ updatetime }}</p>

<p>The graphs below show histograms of time intervals between alerts
  being issued and broker messages being received.  Three time intervals are
  shown:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the total time between the original detection alert being issued
    and the DESC Tom ingesting a broker's classification;
  <li>the time between between the original detection alert being issued
    and the broker publishing a classification (as measured by the
    header of the Kafka message)</li>
  <li>the time between the broker publishing a classification and the
    DESC Tom ingesting that classification.</li>
</ul>

<p>The time of the broker publishing a classification is based on the
  message header from the Kafka stream for brokers who provide
  classifications that way.  For brokers who send to the Tom's REST
  interface, it's the time that the message was received by the
  server.</p>

<p>Some useful unit conversions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>10<span class="sup">2</span>s = 1.7 min</li>
  <li>10<span class="sup">3</span>s = 16.7 min</li>
  <li>10<span class="sup">4</span>s = 2.8 hour</li>
  <li>10<span class="sup">4.5</span>s = 8.8 hour</li>
  <li>10<span class="sup">5</span>s = 27.8 hour</li>
  <li>10<span class="sup">5.5</span>s = 3.7 day</li>
  <li>10<span class="sup">6</span>s = 11.6 day</li>
</ul>
