<p>Streaming and Database Statistics:</p>

<ul>
  <li class="exbelow"><a href="/elasticc/alertstreamhists">Graphs of hourly streaming rate of
      original ELAsTiCC alerts sent to the ZADS broker</a> (updated
      daily)</li>
  <li class="exbelow"><a href="/elasticc/brokerstreamgraphs">Graphs of rate of messages received
      from each broker</a> (updated daily)</li>
  <li class="exbelow"><a href="/elasticc/brokercompletenessgraphs">Classifier
      completeness</a> — fraction of alerts sent each week for which each
    broker/classifier has sent at least one classification (updated
    daily)</li>
  <li class="exbelow"><a href="/elasticc/brokercompletenessvsndets">Classifier
      completeness vs. number of detections</a> — fraction of alerts
      sent for which each broker/classifier has sent at least one
      classification, as a function of the number of detections of that
      object included in the alert.  (Updated manually.)</li>
  <li class="exbelow"><a href="/elasticc/brokertimedelays">Broker Time
      Delays</a> — histogram of time delays between alerts being isused

      daily)</li>
  <li class="exbelow"><a href="/elasticc/probvsclassandt">Each
      broker/classifier's average probability as a function of class ID
      and time relative to peak</a>, broken out by true object
      type.  (Averaged over all objects of that true type.)  (Takes
      several seconds to load.)</li>
