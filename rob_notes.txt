Rob's workflow

  * In the local checked out tree ( $HOME/desc/tom_desc )
     * Edit code
     * Commit and push
  * At /global/cfs/cdirs/m1727/tom/deploy_dev/tom_desc
     * git pull
  * On the spin dev server
     * Run python manage.py makemigrations
     * Fix bugs until that works, editing code in deploy_dev/tom_desc
         ( edit on cori, not the spin server, which doesn't have emacs )
     * Run python manage.py migrate
     * Panic if that didn't work, try to fix it
     * Run kill -HUP 1 to get new code loaded into the server
     * git status
     * git add any migrations that were created and any edited files
     * Commit and push
   * In the local checked out tree:
     * Git pull

When ready to deploy to production:

  * At /global/cfs/cdirs/m1727/tom/deploy_production/tom_desc
     * git pull
  * On the spin production server
     * Run python manage.py migrate
     * Panic if that didn't just work
     * Run kill -HUP 1
